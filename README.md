# Connections Transport App Challenge - Symbiote

###
The goal of this app is to provide a user with the ability to create "connections" for transport stops they make use of regularly. This app allows users to create new connections, and display information about those connections.

## Modules/tools Used ##

##### React Create React App
A really great way to get up and running quickly, configuring Webpack and Babel can sometimes be a pain, having them preconfigured for me meant I can get up and running in no time.

##### React Router #####
React Router is the de-facto React routing library and for good reason, its very easy to get a static web app with a few "pages" connected.

##### Node-sass #####
A no briner, once you go Sass, you'll never go back. I mainly used it because I prefer to seperate my css by theme and I strongly prefer to nest my css elements where possible.

##### Redux #####
Being a small app, I thought it would be better to avoid Redux and keep a simple global state in App.js, however it quickly starting becoming messy, so after some tinkering and some refresher guides on Redux I took the plunge and realised I need to brush up on it.. I did get it holding together nicely in the end. This part of the challenge has proven to be super educational!


## Commands
-`npm install` to install

-`npm start` to start the app

## None issues
- A user can add duplicate stops to their connections - I need to add some logic to the form select options dropdowns
